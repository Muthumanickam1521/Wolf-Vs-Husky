# WOlf Vs. Husky Image Classifier

An image classifier built using deep learning in Python that has potential to predict whether an image has wolf or husky.

## Problem
I find hard to distinguish bewteen a wolf and a hsuky as they are morphologically similar. I find it as a reasonable problem to be solved using data science techniques. 

## Deployment
The model is given a minial user interaface using Streamlit python library. I created a simple data app and deployed it in cloud space offered by streamlit. The app contains an image file uploader. 

## Future work
Though the model identifies 98% accurate, it is not a robust model since it was built with a samll dataset and a single layer CNN. In future versions of this project, i will work on improving other benchmarks such as precision.
